<p>
I love making web things.
<br /><br />
About 15 years ago, after graduating in philosophy and management, I started learning to code by myself. I have since then worked at several agencies and startups in Germany, Canada and New Zealand.
<br /><br />
I have used many frameworks and libraries, for mobile development mainly with Flutter and Dart, and for the web mostly with JavaScript and Nodejs.
<br /><br />
I am more specifically interested in the maintenance and performance issues of growing codebases, and maintain a few open source projects relating to these topics.
<br /><br />
My experience is detailed on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kammerer">linkedin profile</a>,
and I push code <a href="https://github.com/vkammerer">on Github</a> too.

  I love making web things.
  <br /><br />
  About 15 years ago, after graduating in philosophy and management, I started learning to code by myself. I have since
  then worked at several agencies and startups in Germany, Canada and New Zealand.
  <br /><br />
  I have used many frameworks and libraries, for mobile development mainly with Flutter and Dart, and for the web mostly
  with JavaScript and Nodejs.
  <br /><br />
  I am more specifically interested in the maintenance and performance issues of growing codebases, and maintain a few
  open source projects relating to these topics.
  <br /><br />
  My experience is detailed on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kammerer">linkedin profile</a>,
  and I push code <a href="https://github.com/vkammerer">on Github</a> too.

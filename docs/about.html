  I love making web things.<br /><br />

About 8 years ago, after graduating in philosophy and management, I started learning to code by myself. I have since then worked at various positions for agencies and startups, in development, design and marketing.
<br /><br />
I like to:<br />
- define a UI concept and prototype at an early stage<br />
- iterate over the product until it becomes great<br />
- launch it!<br />
- maintain the codebase with care, so that new devs can join the fun<br />
<br />
Over the past years, I have used many of the main frameworks and libraries out there, mostly in javascript and nodejs.
<br /><br />
  My experience is detailed on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kammerer">linkedin profile</a>,
  and I push code <a href="https://github.com/vkammerer">on Github</a> too.
